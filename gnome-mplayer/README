GNOME MPlayer is a simple GUI for MPlayer. It is intended to be a
nice tight player and provide a simple and clean interface to MPlayer.
GNOME MPlayer has a rich API that is exposed via DBus. Using DBus you
can control a single or multiple instances of GNOME MPlayer from a
single command.

MPlayer is required to run GNOME MPlayer.  GConf, libnotify, and 
libmusicbrainz3 are optional build time dependencies.
