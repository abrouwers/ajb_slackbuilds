Quod Libet is a music management program. It provides several
different ways to view your audio library, as well as support
for Internet radio and audio feeds. It has extremely flexible
metadata tag editing and searching capabilities.

gst-python and mutagen are required to build and
gst-plugins-good is required to run Quod Libet. You will
probably also want to install the rest of the GStreamer
plugins (gst-ffmpeg, gst-plugins-bad, and gst-plugins-ugly)
as well. All of these are available at SBo.
