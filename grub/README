This slackbuild will produce a package for grub2.  It is "still experimental"
and "under heavy development," but seems to work well on many hardware setups
(ubuntu ships it already by default, as will fedora for F13).  Can it really
be worse than grub 1 ?

For configuration, a few distributions have some pretty good wiki's on how to 
get grub2 working.  Arch linux has a pretty good write-up on their wiki:
