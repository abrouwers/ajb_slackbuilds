This slackbuild will produce a package for grub2.  It is "still experimental"
and "under heavy development," but seems to work well on many hardware setups
(ubuntu ships it already by default, as will fedora for F13).  Can it really
be worse than grub 1 ?

grub2 has many configuration options, which I won't detail here, but be sure
to check around on-line for grub2's full potential.  If you do not understand
how to boot a liveCD to re-install lilo, you might want to hold off attempting
this conversion.


Conversion from lilo to grub2
------------------------------------

To start, if you're already using lilo in the MBR, it will need to be unloaded
for grub2 to be installed:

# lilo -U /dev/sdX


Next, once grub2 is installed, we will install it to the MBR, and add some
configuration items to /boot.  grub does this via. the grub-install command:

# grub-install /dev/sdX


Once this completes, you should notice a nice entry /boot/ for grub.  The
final step to boot from grub2, is to setup a configuration file.  Grub2 ships
with a utility that can generate one (using scripts in /etc/grub.d/ , which
can be tweaked for completely automated deployment):

# grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg


Or, you can simply create your own from examples.  Below is a simple config. 
that I use to successfully boot my system.

# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE

# It is automatically generated by /sbin/grub-mkconfig using templates
# from /etc/grub.d and settings from /etc/default/grub
