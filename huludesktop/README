HuluDesktop is the official linux client from hulu labs.

In order to use this program, flash must be installed on the system.

When you initially run the huludesktop client, if you have used the flash
slackbuild from slackbuilds.org, it probably won't locate the flash library.
To fix, edit your ~/.huludesktop:

64-bit:
flash_location = /usr/lib64/mozilla/plugins/libflashplayer.so

32-bit:
flash_location = /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/libflashplayer.so
