Arora is a simple cross platform web browser whose feature list
includes things like "History" and "Bookmarks". Benjamin Meyer
originally created as a demo for Qt to help test the QtWebKit component
and find API issues and bugs before the release. Arora works on Linux,
OS X, Windows, FreeBSD, and embedded Linux using Qt Embedded and
anywhere Qt does. For more information about the project check out the
Arora Goals wiki page.

Due to a bug in qt 4.5.1 (which ships with slackware 13), using
the qt from -current is advised (fixes cookie bugs in webkit).
