The GNOME-Colors is a project that aims to make the GNOME desktop as
elegant, consistent and colorful as possible.  The current goal is to
allow full color customization of themes, icons, GDM logins and splash
screens. There are already five full color-schemes available; Noble (Purple),
Brave (Blue), Human (Orange), Wine (Red) and Wise (Green).  GNOME-Colors is
mostly inspired/based on Tango, GNOME, Elementary, Tango-Generator and
many other open-source projects.

Don't forget to set gtk-icon-theme-name attribute in your ~/.gtkrc-2.0
to one of the five color schemes (gnome-noble, gnome-brave, gnome-human,
gnome-wine,and gnome-wise) in order for this icon theme to take effect.
