This repository houses my personal slackbuilds.  Some are available on
slackbuilds.org, others not.  For those that are, it probably means
that they are here because of some tweak that I prefer, and SBo does not.
Others might not follow SBo guideliness completely (eg, pulls SVN code).

Anyway, enjoy, and feel free to send comments / recommendations / patches / 
pieces of broken computer to which these scripts may have caused.
