Teeworlds is a free online multiplayer game, available on all operating
systems.  Battle with up to 16 players in a variety of game modes, including
Team Deathmatch and Capture the Flag.  You can even design your own maps!

This build will require you to also have the tarball for "bam" in the
slackbuild directory, as it will build that first.  Sorry, bam is not worth
installing on its own.
