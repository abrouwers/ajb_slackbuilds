Evince is a document viewer for multiple document formats. It currently 
supports pdf, postscript, djvu, tiff and dvi. The goal of evince is to 
replace the multiple document viewers that exist on the GNOME Desktop with 
a single simple application.

Evince 2.26.x requires gnome-doc-utils as a build time dependency, but not
at runtime.  Further, the "dvi" support is only available if texlive is
installed (disabled by default).
