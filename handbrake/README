Handbrake (gtk interface)

This slackbuild is a little un-traditional, because it will also checkout (and update)
the latest svn from trunk.

The following are required to build the GTK+ version of handbrake.

- Webkit
   - icu4c
   - libsoup
- libnotify
- yasm (build-time dep (x264); not needed to run)

alienbob has packages at his site for the deps - highly recommended, since
compiling website sucks:

Finally, to encode encrypted DVD's, libdvdcss is required.
